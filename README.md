# Kaggle2 -Text Classification 
For this project, you will take part in a 2nd Kaggle competition based on text classification.
You are provided with over 1 millions texts which are annotated as negative, positive and neutral. The task is to create features based on the provided data and use machine learning algorithms to classify them.

You are required to implement and train several classification algorithms based on the dataset provided. The evaluation will be based on the performance on the held out test set and a written report.

The competition, including the data, is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/t/6c98b08e131d49abaa8915175de22ced
